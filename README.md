This repo is meant to contain the work done implementing the 
Hybrid Trajectory Optimization for Persistent Monitoring found here:
https://github.com/hallfjonas/hytoperm

The following instructions for setting up the python environment 
below match those in the original repo. Ensure that you are in the correct
repo and perform the following steps:
1. create a virtual environment
2. activate virtual environment
3. install the requirements

On Ubuntu this can be achieved via:
````
$ virtualenv env --python=python3 
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
````

From here the directions will vary depending on whether you are running
the physical implementation or a simulated implementation.

You can find further instructions in the respective folders, 
as well as details concerning the project state and next steps.
