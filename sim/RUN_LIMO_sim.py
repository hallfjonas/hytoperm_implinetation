"""
This file is used to control a simulation of the AgileX Limos in Rastic to follow a series of Waypoints.
It uses the dynamic model found in nonlinModel.py to find the simulate the motion of the agent.
To use this, create a tracker object and pass the name of any limo,
then pass a numpy array containing the sequence of waypoints to the trackTrajectory function in the following format:
waypoints = np.array([[x1,x2],[y1,y2],[theta1,theta2],[v1,v2]])
for waypoints waypoint1 = np.array([[x1],[y1],[theta1],[v1]]), waypoint2 = np.array([[x2],[y2],[theta2],[v2]]),
For best results, try to ensure that trajectories were generated based on the Limo's dynamic model.
This code was adapted by Carter Berlind with significant changes.
Original code received from Sienna Chien, original authors not listed.
